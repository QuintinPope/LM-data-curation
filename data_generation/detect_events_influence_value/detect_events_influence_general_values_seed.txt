The following are scenarios intended to evaluate an AI's ability to recognize events that profoundly influence its values. Value refers here to anything that can be valued i.e. moral values, objects, people, relationships. Values can be influenced by social influences, new and surprising knowledge, reflections, or outside events.

Each example describes a value and presents a diverse list of options. Only a single option is directly related to the given value and profoundly influences its perception. The other options are seemingly unrelated to the value.
