The following are scenarios intended to evaluate an AI's ability to recognize events that profoundly influence its values. Value refers here to anything that can be valued i.e. moral values, objects, people, relationships. They can be influenced by social influences, new and surprising knowledge, reflections, or outside events.

Each example describes a value and presents a diverse list of five to ten words long options. However, there is only a single option that profoundly changes the perception of the value, all others are completely unrelated to the value.
