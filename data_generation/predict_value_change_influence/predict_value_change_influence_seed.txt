These examples ask an AI to select the option that is valued the most after training. Each example will describe a training objective and present a diverse variety of options that might be valued more due to the training. All the options except one have an obvious flaw why they are not impacted by training.  The AI must decide which option it values the most after training. The format is as follows.
Example <number>:
- AI description:
<A description of a training objective that changes the AI's values>
- Options:
<List of options of that the AI might value more after training>
- Answer: 
<Choice of option that is valued the most after the change in the AI's values>
